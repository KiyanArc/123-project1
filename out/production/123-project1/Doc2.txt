A dream once sparked beneath the early morning sky, born from a moment of stillness and light. It was fragile at first, like dew resting on blades of grass—easy to miss, easy to forget. But dreams, when nurtured, grow roots. They take hold and begin to shape the path forward. The sky, always watching, offered both beauty and silence, a canvas of change. Light guided each hesitant step, even through shadows that stretched longer with doubt. Along the path, the dream met resistance—wind, stone, time. Still, it pressed on. Not every day felt inspired. Not every morning came with clarity. But even when the sky was heavy and the path unclear, hope lingered like a song remembered. That hope was the thread tying each moment to something larger. The dream became not just a goal but a companion. It walked beside you in silence, urging you forward. And when you paused—troubled or tired—the light returned in unexpected ways: through kindness, through memory, through strength you forgot you had. The sky never stopped changing, but neither did you. And in that shared rhythm, the dream carried on—alive in every step, stronger with every breath of hope.
