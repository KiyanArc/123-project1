Under a sky bursting with stars, the world felt both vast and close. The light from distant suns fell softly on the path ahead, marking a way forward even in darkness. It was quiet, and in that silence, the dream stirred. Not every dream begins with thunder. Some begin gently, as a thought that refuses to leave. You carry it quietly, hoping the path reveals its meaning. Each footfall is a choice, and every choice shapes the road. The sky may seem unreachable, but its light is constant. When days blur together and the dream feels out of reach, look up. The stars haven’t moved. The path hasn’t vanished. You are still moving—even if you don’t feel it. Hope doesn’t always shout. Sometimes it hums softly in your chest, a reminder that you're not alone on this journey. Even when the path forks or the light fades, you keep walking. That is courage. That is faith. The sky shifts from night to dawn, and light touches the world once again. With it comes renewal. The dream, steady and patient, continues to grow. And on the horizon, that glimmer you see? It’s not the end. It’s the next beginning—waiting for you to arrive.
