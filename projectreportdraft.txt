Problems:
Arrays have a fixed size, so it cannot be used as documents values in the hashmap. So, hash sets were used.
Reading of documents was hardcoded, thereby taking more memory in the code. So implemented a for loop
Scanner is slow. So Bufferred reader was implemented instead.
Cannot read words with apostrophe. Need to fix.
